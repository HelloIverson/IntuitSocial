# Projekt Sekond
Our idea for the Intuit Social Innovation challenge 2022.

Starting in business is very difficult for those that are part of minority groups. They find themselves facing struggles that range from being barred from higher positions, to general inability to enter the field to begin with. And this is something that must be changed. We introduce Projekt Sekond, the website that aims to help these minorities connect, establish, and enter the workforce with the opportunities and ablity that they should have.

**Final roster hopefully out today**

**Current Roster:**  
Anhkhoa Le (Team Leader)  
Jeffrey Zou (Project Lead)  
Arivan Verma (Lead of Pitch Design)  
Tyler Le (Editor)  
Jonah Fearnley (Python Head and Lead of Intuit Decision)  
Micah Tien (Main Code Lead)  
Brannon Lai (Moral Support)

Good job beating out finals everyone! We're in the endgame now, hope everyone realizes how well we've all done. But we can't stop yet team. We still have a lot to do, and not a lot of time to do it. So I'll be planning out a rough outline for the next few days to help us get on track. Remember, these are suggestions and not binding, feel free to request changes to your tasks if you feel the need to.

---

## 10/23 - 10/25

### Anhkhoa:

- Get us any necessary information that we need for finals. Video length, mural board requirements, submission dates, we need it all to be precise if we're winning this.

- Schedule a meeting with Ian. To my understanding you are the only one who has their contact, so we'll be relying on you buddy.

- Guide Arivan and Johan through their tasks, fill in any gaps and holes that they can't fill.

- Lead the design on the mural board while Johan is taking the course, once he is done get him working on it.

### Me:

- I will be migrating all of the current code onto a local server for these next few days.

- Coordinate all code changes with me either through issue/pull requests or a direct message.

- Give information about interviewees and users to me so I can test the database.

### Micah Tien:

- Your job this week (you get longer since it's kinda hard) is to create PHP classes for the header, footer, and each page style in general. This will be very important to functionality, so make sure you can at least somewhat figure it out.

- Create an account profile class using PHP. You don't necessarily have to work the SQL, but if you would like to it would be a great help.

- Coordinate all efforts and questions through me and Brannon so we can have clear and effective communication.

### Brannon Lai:

- Your goal this week is to make a search bar through HTML, and to connect search queries to either the JS or PHP. Take whatever measures necessary.

- Coordinate all efforts and questions through me and Micah so we can have clear and effective communication.

### Tech Team General Notes:

- Please use pull requests/issues. I can not stress how important they are, especially for large changes.

- I would suggest using a personal IDE/text editor for these next few days, they will be a lot faster than Github Pages.

### Jonah Fearnley:

- Continue working on the course. The completion is highly important to the success to the project.

- Make sure to work with Anhkhoa to fill any requests he might have, and feel free to submit requests for him too.

### Darren Stane:

- Honestly just do whatever you're doing great so far.

### Creative Team General Notes:

- Focus on the Mural board, interviews, and course, for those are what are most important.

- If you have any down time or are bored in any way, feel free to think of things we can put on the website or mural board, you guys are creative for a reason.

### Tyler Le:

- Times seem tough for you right now so feel free to just take a break for a bit. Once you feel better we can get you working on tasks, but just focus on yourself for now. (Note from Tyler: Tell me if you need an edit done, I'm free on uptime so yeah)

### Everyone:

- Deadline is soon, but also don't rush through any of this. We want quality work.

- Remember school still is a thing, don't slack there, but also this is more fun :)
